Welcome to Explorations Unfolded, where curiosity drives everything I do. This blog is a space to capture and share my explorations across photography, app and product development, investment strategies, and travel, especially in China. As I experiment, learn, and grow in each of these areas, I aim to unfold my experiences in a way that's informative, insightful, and hopefully, inspiring.
