Hey there!

Welcome to jiajia's Explorations Unfolded. This blog is a space to capture and share my learning and explorations across photography, product design/development, investment strategies, and travel experiences. As I experiment, learn, and grow in each of these areas, I aim to unfold my experiences in a way that's informative, insightful, and hopefully, inspiring.

I hope one day when I look back at the posts, I would feel a sense of accomplishment.
