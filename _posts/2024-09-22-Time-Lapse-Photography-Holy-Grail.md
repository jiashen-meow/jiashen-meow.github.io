#### **Time-Lapse Photography**

**Time-lapse** photography is a technique where a series of photos are taken at set intervals over a period of time and then played back at a much faster speed than real life. This creates a video that compresses time, making slow processes—like the movement of clouds, the blooming of flowers, or a sunset—appear to happen quickly. (Source: ChatGPT)

The **purposes** of time-lapse photography are to:
- Create an interesting video showing architectural changes and movement in the background (clouds, sunrise, sunset, etc.)
- Select a few outstanding photos from the hundreds or thousands taken during the period

**Use cases** include b-roll within videos, landscape photography showcases, and more.

**Holy Grail** time-lapse refers to time-lapse photography under day-to-night or night-to-day conditions.

#### **Camera and Settings**

Camera           | Lens                  | Focal Length     | Aperture         | ISO              | Shutter Speed
---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------
Sony A6600       | 18-135mm              | 18mm             | 5.6 / 6.3        | 100              | varies (auto)

The interval was set to 6 seconds initially, then adjusted to 12 seconds on Day 1 and 16 seconds on Day 2.  
Aperture priority mode was on.

On Day 1, f/6.3 and f/5.6 were used. ISO was fixed at 100. Shutter speed was adjusted automatically by the camera.

On Day 2, I mistakenly set the aperture to f/16, thinking it would open up for more light. I was wrong—the f-number should go down to allow more light in.  
f/16 was used, and ISO was set to 320. Shutter speed was auto.

#### **Problems Encountered**

##### Shutter Speed's Duration Longer than Shooting Interval

The exposure triangle consists of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. A well-exposed picture is neither too bright (overexposed) nor too dark (underexposed). To achieve correct exposure, the components of the exposure triangle must be set correctly.

In aperture priority mode, the aperture is set manually while ISO and shutter speed are automatically adjusted by the camera.

I manually set the ISO to 100 (a low value), so the camera compensated by increasing the exposure time, resulting in slower shutter speeds. I had set the shooting interval at 6 seconds, but as the shutter speed became longer, it eventually exceeded the interval (>6 seconds). When the shutter speed (8s) is longer than the interval (6s), the camera respects the shutter speed and skips shots, resulting in a longer actual interval—this is my guess.

During this shoot, I manually changed the interval to 12 seconds instead of 6. The result was that objects in the foreground (e.g., boats on the river, lights on buildings) moved too quickly.

##### The Final Result Was 'Meh' Due to Dull Foreground

Time-lapse videos become interesting when both the foreground and background have dynamic changes. It could be the combination of moving cars and cloud movements, or building lights against a sunset.

In this case, the first 11 seconds of the Day 1 video had a dark foreground as the buildings hadn't lit up yet. Even with moving clouds and a beautiful sky, the dull foreground couldn't be saved.

#### **Summary**

##### Updated Settings

**Aperture priority**

- f/3.5 (to allow as much light in as possible)

**ISO**

- Auto 100-400 (if planning to use individual photos) or Auto 100-3200 (if only making the time-lapse video)
- ISO auto min. shutter speed: 4" (pushing shutter speed to a certain limit before ramping up the ISO)

**Interval Shooting Functions**

- Shooting interval: 6 seconds
- Shoot interval priority: On (prioritize interval over shutter speed)

I look forward to using these updated settings on my next shoot!
