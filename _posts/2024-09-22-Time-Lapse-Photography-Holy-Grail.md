#### **Time Lapse Photography**

**Time Lapse** photography is a technique where a series of photos are taken at set intervals over a period of time and then played back at a much faster speed than real life. This creates a video that compresses time, making slow processes—like the movement of clouds, the blooming of flowers, or a sunset—appear to happen quickly. (source: ChatGPT)

The **purposes** of taking time lapse photography are..
- create an interesting video showing the changes of the architectures and movement of the background (clouds, sunrise, sunset, etc.)
- select a few outstanding photos out of the hundreds or thousands photos taken during the period

**Usecases** include b-roll within videos, landscape photography showcasing and so on.

**Holy Grail** time lapse is the version of time lapse photography under day-to-night or night-to-day conditions.

#### **Camera and Settings**

Camera           | Lens                  | Focal Length     | Aperture         | iso              | Shutter Speed
---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------
Sony A6600       | 18-135mm              | 18mm             | 5.6 / 6.3        | 100              | varies (auto)

The interval was set to 6 secs initially. It was then set to 12 secs on day 1 and 16 secs on day 2.
Aperture priority mode was on.

On Day 1, f/6.3 and f/5.6 was used. ISO was set to a fixed value - 100.
Shutter speed was adjusted automatically by the camera.

On Day 2, I mistakenlly set aperture to f/16 as I thought it would open up for more light. Apparently I was wrong, the F number should go down to open up more light.
f/16 was used, and ISO was set to 320.
Shutter speed was auto.

#### **Problem Encountered**
##### Shutter Speed's duration is longer than shooting interval
The exposure triangle consists of aperture, shutter speed, and iso. A well-exposed picture means it's not too bright so a large portion of the pictures are white or not too dark so details are hidden within the shades. To make sure a picture is correctly exposed, the components of the exposure triangle need to be set correctly.

Under aperture priority mode, an aperture is set manually while the other two components (iso and shutter speed) are automatically adjusted by the camera.

This time I have also manually set the iso to 100 (which is a low number). In order to keep the picture well-exposed, the camera had to compensate with longer exposure time, thus slower shutter speed. I had set the shooting interval at 6 secs, but soon the shutter speed is getting longer and longer and finally exceeds the set interval (> 6 secs). When shutter speed is longer than the set interval, the camera would respect the shutter speed and skip the photo shooting at the set interval. The end result would probably the interval would probably double <- this is my guess).

During this shooting, I manually changed the interval to 12-sec instead of 6-sec. The end result is the changes in the photo happen too fast (i.e. boats across the Huangpu River, the lights on the building, etc.).

##### The final result was meh due to dull foreground
The time-lapse video gets interesting if both the foreground and background have changes. It could be the combination of moving cars vs. cloud movements, lights on buildings vs. sunset, etc.
During this shooting, I found the first 11 secs of the Day 1 video have dark foreground as the buildings weren't lit up yet. Even the moving clouds and beautiful sky couldn't save the dullness of the foreground.

#### **Summary**

##### Settings Update

Aperture priority 

- f/3.5 (allows as much light in as possible)

ISO

- auto 100-400 (if wants to use individual photos) or auto 100-3200 (if only wants to make the time-lapse video)
- ISO auto min. SS: 4" (pushing shutter speed to certain limit before ramping up the ISO)

Interval Shooting Functions

- Shooting interval: 6s
- Shoot interval priority: On (prioritize interval over shutter speed)

I am looking forward to using the updated settings on my next photo shooting!
