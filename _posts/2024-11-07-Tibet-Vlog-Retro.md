#### **Intro**

During this year's China National Day Holiday, I went to Tibet with a few friends. Tibet has magnificent landscape, long history, and unique culture. Its majestic architecture and tibetan buddahism traditions left me strong impressions. This article will record the vlog's equipment, reflect on the vlog making process, finally summarize the lesson-learnt and finally document useful resources for future vlog making.

#### **Camera and Settings**

Camera               | Lens         | Resolution      | Comment
-------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------
Iphone 12            | -            | HD              | Could actually do 4K
DJI Avata 2          | -            | HD              | Could actually do 4K
DJI Osmo Pocket 1    | -            | 4K              | -
Sony A6600           | 18-135 mm    | 4K              | Steady shot was not turned on
                     | 50 mm        | 4K              | Steady shot was not turned on

Iphone 12 and DJI Avata 2 have 4K resolustion but was not turned on.

Sony A6600 was mostly used for photography. The limited videos were shaky due to lack of steady shot, but post processing can use algorithm to correct the shakiness.

#### **Content Creation**

No pre-production was done whatsoever. I researched about sightseeing in Tibet with a few articles and videos. I bought Lonely Planet's Tibet version, which is quite helpful.

#### **Editing**

Duration      | Tasks            
------------- | --------------------
2 days        | Organizing footage
1 day         | Started editing
1 day         | Animal World editing
2 days        | Edit in order of time of the event
1 day         | Motion Graphics
1 day         | Music, record narration and sound mix
1 day         | Subtitles + export
1/2 day       | Bilibili cover making + upload

In total of 9 1/2 days

Duration      | Tasks            
------------- | --------------------
1 day         | English narration, English motion graphics
1 day         | Record narration
1 day         | Editing + Export + Upload

In total of 3 days

First a few days is most painful. Without any ideas before editing can lead to waste of time researching, endless bilibili/youtube watching, copying other people's work then finding out it doesn't work, and going back to researching. It's like a vortex.

After 2 days of organizing footage in chronicle order and tagging categories, some pattern starts showing up - for example, animal world, etc.

Deciding what style to use for the vlog is difficult. I was debating between asian tv shows and calm narrative vlog style. I went for the asian tv show style but stopped due to lack of footage of people.


#### **Lesson-learned**

**Pre-production**
Not sure to what extent pre-production should be done for vlog, but it's needed especially when one is new to filmmaking (like me!!). There are a few problems due to lack of pre-production:

- mundane shots (don't have emotions, too flat
- repeated shots (also due to not keeping record of what have been shot
- no continuous story line (painful to come up with storyline in post-production

What can be prepared beforehand to avoid the problems:

- research the destination, understand what's unique about the destination, get a sense roughly what kind of scenes will happen at the destination (is it people, is it architecture, is it actions, etc.), what emotion will be captured, what kind of shot/camera movement should pair with it
- bookeeping while traveling to make sure what content has been included

**Keeping shots interesting**

- Zoom in while shooting instead of leaving it to editing in post-production
- Techniques to keep shots interesting: slow motion, slow shutter, step printing (Wong Kar-Wai style), EFFECTIVE camera movement, etc.
- and of course, keep accummulating filmmaking senses...!

**Don't be stressed**

Chaos is a must-go-through-stage while editing. Don't set too high of an expectation. Remember get it done is more important than make it perfect. I'm always improving :) and there is always a next one.
