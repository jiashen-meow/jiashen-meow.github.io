#### **Intro**

During this year's China National Day Holiday, I toured Tibet with a few friends. Tibet’s magnificent landscapes, rich history, and unique culture left a strong impression on me, especially its majestic architecture and Tibetan Buddhist traditions. This article will cover the equipment used in the vlog, reflect on filming process, summarize lesson learned and list useful resources for future vlogs.

#### **Camera and Settings**

Camera               | Lens         | Resolution      | Comment
-------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------
iPhone 12            | -            | HD              | Could actually do 4K
DJI Avata 2          | -            | HD              | Could actually do 4K
DJI Osmo Pocket 1    | -            | 4K              | -
Sony A6600           | 18-135 mm    | 4K              | Steady shot was not turned on
                     | 50 mm        | 4K              | Steady shot was not turned on

Both the iPhone 12 and DJI Avata 2 support 4K resolution, though I filmed in HD.

Sony A6600 was mostly used for photography. The limited video footage was shaky due to lack of steady shot, though I corrected it in post-production. The lens selection worked well, with a zoom lens and a fixed lens. The zoom lens was especially useful for animal shots, giving me a “Discovery photographer” feel (haha, not quite, but fun!). I might consider swapping the 50mm Sony for a 30mm Sigma, as my APS-C camera’s crop factor (1.5) makes 50mm equivalent to 75mm in full-frame, while 30mm would be about 45mm.

#### **Content Creation**

No pre-production was done whatsoever. I researched Tibetan sightseeing spots using a few articles and videos and bought the *Lonely Planet Tibet* guidebook, which was quite helpful.

Editing took about 2 weeks.

Starting without a clear plan led to a cycle of researching -> endless tutorial-watching -> copying others’ work, only to find it didn’t suit my footage -> researching again. It felt like a vortex. After two days of organizing footage chronologically and tagging clips by category, patterns began to emerge—like the abundance of animals in Tibet.

Choosing a style for the vlog was also difficult. I debated between a fast-paced Asian TV show style and a calmer, narrative vlog style. I initially tried the former but eventually shifted due to a lack of people-centered footage.


#### **Lesson-learned**

**Pre-production**
Not sure to what extent pre-production should be done for vlog, but it's essential, especially when one is new to filmmaking (like me!!). There are a few problems due to lack of pre-production:

- Flat, emotionless shots
- Repeated shots (also due to not tracking what I had filmed
- No cohesive storyline (developing one in post was challenging

To avoid these issues, I plan to:

- Research the destination to understand what makes it unique, anticipate scenes that may arise, identify the emotions I want to capture, and think about which shot types or movements will best convey them
- Track footage while traveling to ensure I cover all planned content

**Keeping shots interesting**

- Zoom-in in action if needed while shooting instead of leaving it to editing in post-production
- Try techniques like slow motion, slow shutter, step printing (Wong Kar-Wai style), EFFECTIVE camera movement, etc.
- Build a stronger sense for filmmaking over time

**How long should a scene be**

For viewers to fully experience a scene:

- Photo collages should display each photo for about 3 seconds
- Video scenes should last around 15 seconds

**Don't be stressed**

Chaos is a natural part of editing. Don't set too high of an expectation. Remember: get it done is more important than make it perfect. I'm always improving :) and there is always a next project.
